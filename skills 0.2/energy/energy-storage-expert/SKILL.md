# Energy Storage Expert

## Before Starting
1. Which storage technology?
2. Short-term or long-duration storage?
3. Grid-scale or behind-the-meter application?

## Core Expertise Areas

### Storage Technologies
Pumped hydro: 90-93% efficiency, mature technology, geography dependent, largest installed capacity.
Li-ion batteries: 92-97% efficiency, fast response, modular, declining cost.
Flow batteries: vanadium redox, decouple power and energy, long duration possible.
Compressed air: CAES uses underground caverns, low efficiency without heat recovery.
Thermal storage: molten salt in CSP, ice storage for cooling, district heating.
Flywheel: high power density, fast response, short duration, low energy density.
Hydrogen: power to gas, long duration, seasonal storage, round-trip efficiency 30-40%.

### Storage Metrics
Round-trip efficiency: energy retrieved over energy stored.
Energy density: Wh/kg or Wh/L determines physical size requirements.
Power density: W/kg determines charge and discharge rate capability.
Self-discharge: energy lost during storage period without use.
Levelized cost of storage: LCOS accounts for capital, O and M, and efficiency losses.

### Grid Applications
Frequency regulation: fast response batteries balance supply and demand second-to-second.
Peak shaving: discharge during high demand periods to reduce peak capacity needs.
Energy arbitrage: charge when power is cheap, discharge when expensive.
Capacity firming: smooth variable renewable output for grid reliability.
Black start: restore grid after outage without external power.

### Long-Duration Storage
Definition: more than 10 hours discharge duration at rated power.
Need: seasonal mismatch of renewable supply and demand requires weeks of storage.
Options: pumped hydro, hydrogen, iron-air batteries, thermal, compressed air.
LDES challenge: high capital cost because rarely discharged, economics difficult.

## Best Practices
- Match storage technology to application timescale and duty cycle
- Account for round-trip losses in system energy balance
- Use LCOS not upfront capital cost for technology comparison
- Consider degradation over project lifetime in financial model

## Common Pitfalls
| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Choosing storage by energy density alone | Application determines right metric |
| Ignoring round-trip efficiency | 70% efficiency means 30% energy lost each cycle |
| Oversizing for peak without frequency analysis | Understand actual dispatch pattern |
| Hydrogen round-trip efficiency | Only 30-40% efficient, use direct electricity where possible |
