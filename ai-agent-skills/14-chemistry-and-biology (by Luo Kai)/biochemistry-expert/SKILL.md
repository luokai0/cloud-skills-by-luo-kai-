## Amino Acids & Protein Structure
```
20 standard amino acids:
  Nonpolar/hydrophobic: Gly(G), Ala(A), Val(V), Leu(L), Ile(I),
                        Pro(P), Phe(F), Trp(W), Met(M)
  Polar uncharged:      Ser(S), Thr(T), Cys(C), Tyr(Y), Asn(N), Gln(Q)
  Positively charged:   Lys(K), Arg(R), His(H)  (basic)
  Negatively charged:   Asp(D), Glu(E)  (acidic)

Amino acid chemistry:
  General structure: H₂N-CHR-COOH  (α-carbon with R group)
  Zwitterion at physiological pH
  pKa: α-COOH ~2, α-NH₃⁺ ~9-10, R groups variable
  Henderson-Hasselbalch: pH = pKa + log([A⁻]/[HA])

Protein structure levels:
  Primary:   amino acid sequence (covalent peptide bonds)
  Secondary: local regular structures
    α-helix: 3.6 residues/turn, H-bonds i to i+4
    β-sheet: parallel or antiparallel, H-bonds between strands
    β-turn: reverses chain direction, H-bond i to i+3
    Random coil: no regular structure
  Tertiary:  overall 3D fold (hydrophobic core, disulfide bonds, H-bonds)
  Quaternary: multiple subunits (hemoglobin: 2α+2β)

Forces stabilizing structure:
  Hydrophobic effect: nonpolar residues buried (dominant)
  H-bonds: backbone and side chains
  Electrostatic: salt bridges, charge-charge
  Van der Waals: weak, short-range
  Disulfide bonds: covalent, extracellular proteins

Protein folding:
  Anfinsen's dogma: sequence determines structure
  Chaperones (Hsp70, GroEL): prevent misfolding
  Prions: misfolded proteins that propagate (PrPSc)
  Amyloids: β-sheet aggregates (Alzheimer's Aβ, Parkinson's α-syn)
```

## Enzyme Kinetics
```
Michaelis-Menten:
  E + S ⇌ ES → E + P
  v = Vmax[S] / (Km + [S])
  Vmax = kcat[E]total
  Km ≈ affinity (lower Km = higher affinity)
  kcat = turnover number (catalytic efficiency)
  kcat/Km = specificity constant (catalytic efficiency)

Lineweaver-Burk (double reciprocal):
  1/v = (Km/Vmax)(1/[S]) + 1/Vmax
  Y-intercept = 1/Vmax, X-intercept = -1/Km, slope = Km/Vmax

Inhibition types:
  Competitive:
    Inhibitor binds active site, competes with substrate
    Km increases, Vmax unchanged
    1/v = (Km/Vmax)(1+[I]/Ki)(1/[S]) + 1/Vmax
    Overcome by high [S]

  Uncompetitive:
    Inhibitor binds only ES complex
    Both Km and Vmax decrease (ratio stays same)
    Parallel lines on Lineweaver-Burk

  Noncompetitive:
    Inhibitor binds E or ES, not active site
    Vmax decreases, Km unchanged
    Same X-intercept on Lineweaver-Burk

  Mixed:
    Inhibitor binds E and ES with different affinities
    Both Km and Vmax change

Allosteric regulation:
  Effectors bind at sites other than active site
  Sigmoidal kinetics: v = Vmax[S]ⁿ/(K₀.₅ⁿ + [S]ⁿ)
  n = Hill coefficient (>1 = positive cooperativity)
  Feedback inhibition: end product inhibits first enzyme
  Feedforward activation: substrate activates downstream enzyme

Enzyme mechanisms:
  Acid-base catalysis: active site residues as H⁺ donors/acceptors
  Covalent catalysis: Ser, Cys, Lys form covalent intermediates
  Metal ion catalysis: Lewis acid activation, redox
  Proximity/orientation: bring substrates together correctly
  Transition state stabilization: reduce Ea by binding TS tightly

## Oxidative Phosphorylation
```
Electron Transport Chain (ETC):
  Location: inner mitochondrial membrane
  NADH → Complex I → CoQ → Complex III → Cyt c → Complex IV → O₂
  FADH₂ → Complex II → CoQ → Complex III → ...

  Complex I (NADH dehydrogenase): NADH → NAD⁺, pumps 4H⁺
  Complex II (succinate dehydrogenase): FADH₂ → FAD (no pumping)
  Complex III (cytochrome bc₁): pumps 4H⁺
  Complex IV (cytochrome c oxidase): pumps 2H⁺, reduces O₂ → H₂O

Chemiosmotic theory (Mitchell):
  H⁺ gradient (proton motive force) drives ATP synthesis
  ΔG = -2.303RT·log([H⁺]in/[H⁺]out) + ZFΔψ
  PMF drives ATP synthase (Complex V)

ATP synthase (Complex V):
  F₀ (membrane): c-ring rotates driven by H⁺ flow
  F₁ (matrix): α₃β₃ catalytic hexamer, 3 ATPs per 360° rotation
  ~2.7 H⁺ per ATP (c-ring has 8-15 subunits depending on species)

ATP yield per glucose (approximate):
  Glycolysis: 2 ATP + 2 NADH (cytoplasmic)
  Pyruvate → Acetyl-CoA: 2 NADH (mitochondrial)
  TCA cycle: 6 NADH + 2 FADH₂ + 2 GTP
  ETC: NADH → 2.5 ATP, FADH₂ → 1.5 ATP
  Total: ~30-32 ATP per glucose (theoretical maximum)

Uncoupling:
  Proton leak bypasses ATP synthase → heat not ATP
  Uncoupling proteins (UCP1): brown adipose tissue thermogenesis
  Dinitrophenol (DNP): artificial uncoupler (historically used for weight loss)

## Lipid Metabolism
```
Fatty acid oxidation (β-oxidation):
  Location: mitochondrial matrix
  Activated: Fatty acid + CoA + ATP → Acyl-CoA + AMP + PPi
  Each cycle removes 2C as Acetyl-CoA:
    Acyl-CoA → trans-Δ²-Enoyl-CoA (FAD → FADH₂)
    → L-3-Hydroxyacyl-CoA (H₂O addition)
    → 3-Ketoacyl-CoA (NAD⁺ → NADH)
    → Acetyl-CoA + shorter Acyl-CoA (thiolysis)

  Palmitate (16C): 7 cycles → 8 Acetyl-CoA + 7 FADH₂ + 7 NADH
  ATP from palmitate: 7×1.5 + 7×2.5 + 8×10 - 2 (activation) = 106 ATP

Ketone bodies:
  Formed in liver during fasting from excess Acetyl-CoA
  Acetoacetate, β-hydroxybutyrate, acetone
  Exported to brain, heart, muscle as fuel
  Diabetic ketoacidosis: uncontrolled ketone production

Fatty acid synthesis:
  Location: cytoplasm
  Acetyl-CoA (mitochondria) → citrate shuttle → cytoplasm
  Acetyl-CoA + CO₂ + ATP → Malonyl-CoA (ACC, rate-limiting)
  FAS (fatty acid synthase): adds 2C units as Malonyl-CoA
  Net: 8 Acetyl-CoA + 7 ATP + 14 NADPH → Palmitate

Membrane lipids:
  Phospholipids: glycerol backbone, 2 FA, phosphate headgroup
  Sphingolipids: sphingosine backbone (ceramide core)
  Cholesterol: 4 fused rings, membrane fluidity, steroid precursor
  Fluid mosaic model: lateral diffusion in bilayer

## Bioenergetics
```
Free energy in biochemistry:
  ΔG = ΔG° + RT·ln(Q)
  ΔG° = -RT·ln(K_eq)
  ATP hydrolysis: ΔG° = -30.5 kJ/mol
  In cell: ΔG ≈ -50 kJ/mol (non-equilibrium conditions)

High-energy compounds:
  Phosphoanhydrides: ATP, ADP (hydrolysis -30.5 kJ/mol)
  Acyl phosphates: 1,3-BPG (-49 kJ/mol)
  Enol phosphates: PEP (-62 kJ/mol)
  Thioesters: Acetyl-CoA (-31 kJ/mol)
  Creatine phosphate: (-43 kJ/mol, muscle energy buffer)

Coupled reactions:
  Unfavorable reaction: ΔG > 0
  Couple with ATP hydrolysis: ΔG_total < 0
  Example: Glucose + Pi → G6P ΔG°= +14 kJ/mol
           ATP → ADP + Pi  ΔG°= -30.5 kJ/mol
           Net:            ΔG°= -16.5 kJ/mol ✓

Redox biochemistry:
  Reduction potential E°′ (biochemical standard)
  NAD⁺/NADH: E°′ = -0.32 V  (good reductant)
  FAD/FADH₂:  E°′ = -0.22 V
  O₂/H₂O:     E°′ = +0.82 V  (good oxidant)
  ΔG°′ = -nFΔE°′
  NADH → O₂: ΔE°′ = 1.14 V, ΔG°′ = -220 kJ/mol
  → enough for ~2.5 ATP synthesis

Photosynthesis:
  Light reactions: H₂O → O₂ + NADPH + ATP (thylakoid membrane)
  Calvin cycle: CO₂ + NADPH + ATP → G3P (stroma)
  Z-scheme: PSI and PSII connected by plastoquinone, plastocyanin
  Rubisco: CO₂ + RuBP → 2× 3-PGA (most abundant enzyme on Earth)
  C4 plants: concentrate CO₂ to overcome photorespiration (corn, sugarcane)

## Key Metabolic Regulation
```
Hormonal regulation:
  Fed state (insulin high):
    ↑ Glycolysis, glycogen synthesis, fatty acid synthesis, protein synthesis
    ↓ Gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, β-oxidation
  Fasted state (glucagon/epinephrine high):
    ↑ Gluconeogenesis, glycogenolysis, β-oxidation, ketogenesis
    ↓ Glycolysis, glycogen synthesis, fatty acid synthesis

Energy sensor: AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK)
  Activated when AMP/ATP ratio high (low energy)
  Stimulates catabolism (β-oxidation, glycolysis)
  Inhibits anabolism (fatty acid synthesis, gluconeogenesis)

Metabolic syndrome:
  Insulin resistance: cells don't respond to insulin → hyperglycemia
  Type 2 diabetes: pancreas exhausted → insufficient insulin
  Obesity: excess calorie storage as triglycerides
  NAFLD: fat accumulation in liver

Key regulatory enzymes:
  Glycolysis: PFK-1 (+ AMP, F2,6BP; - ATP, citrate)
  Gluconeogenesis: FBPase-1 (+ ATP; - AMP, F2,6BP)
  TCA: isocitrate DH (+ ADP, Ca²⁺; - ATP, NADH)
  Fatty acid synthesis: ACC (+ citrate; - palmitoyl-CoA)
  β-oxidation: carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (- malonyl-CoA)
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Km = affinity always | Lower Km = higher affinity only for simple Michaelis-Menten |
| ATP count confusion | ~30-32 ATP per glucose (not 36-38, older textbook values) |
| Glycolysis location | Cytoplasm, NOT mitochondria |
| β-oxidation products | Acetyl-CoA + FADH₂ + NADH per cycle (not just ATP) |
| Competitive vs noncompetitive | Competitive: Km changes; Noncompetitive: Vmax changes |
| Anabolism uses NADPH not NADH | Biosynthesis requires NADPH; catabolism produces NADH |
