## Postulates of Quantum Mechanics
```
1. STATE:
   A quantum system is completely described by a
   wave function ψ(r,t) or state vector |ψ⟩ in Hilbert space.

2. OBSERVABLES:
   Every observable A corresponds to a Hermitian operator Â.
   Hermitian: Â = Â†  →  real eigenvalues, orthogonal eigenstates.

3. MEASUREMENT:
   Measuring A gives eigenvalue aₙ with probability |⟨aₙ|ψ⟩|².
   After measurement: state collapses to eigenstate |aₙ⟩.

4. EXPECTATION VALUE:
   ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|Â|ψ⟩ = ∫ψ* Â ψ dV

5. TIME EVOLUTION:
   iℏ ∂|ψ⟩/∂t = Ĥ|ψ⟩  (Schrodinger equation)
```

## Schrodinger Equation
```
Time-Dependent:
  iℏ ∂ψ/∂t = Ĥψ
  Ĥ = -ℏ²/2m ∇² + V(r,t)

Time-Independent (stationary states):
  Ĥψ = Eψ
  -ℏ²/2m d²ψ/dx² + V(x)ψ = Eψ

General solution:
  Ψ(x,t) = Σcₙψₙ(x)e^(-iEₙt/ℏ)

Probability density:    ρ = |ψ|² = ψ*ψ
Normalization:          ∫|ψ|² dV = 1
Probability current:    J = (ℏ/2mi)(ψ*∇ψ - ψ∇ψ*)
Continuity:             ∂ρ/∂t + ∇·J = 0
```

---

## Dirac Notation
```
State vector:      |ψ⟩  (ket)
Dual vector:       ⟨ψ|  (bra)
Inner product:     ⟨φ|ψ⟩ = ∫φ*ψ dV
Outer product:     |ψ⟩⟨φ|  (operator)
Completeness:      Σₙ|n⟩⟨n| = Î
Orthonormality:    ⟨m|n⟩ = δₘₙ

Operator in basis: Aₘₙ = ⟨m|Â|n⟩  (matrix element)
Expectation:       ⟨A⟩ = ⟨ψ|Â|ψ⟩

Position basis:    ⟨x|ψ⟩ = ψ(x)
Momentum basis:    ⟨p|ψ⟩ = φ(p)

Momentum operator: p̂ = -iℏ∇  (position basis)
Position operator: x̂ = iℏ∂/∂p (momentum basis)
```

## Operators & Commutators
```
Commutator:     [Â,B̂] = ÂB̂ - B̂Â

Canonical commutation relations:
  [x̂,p̂] = iℏ
  [xᵢ,pⱼ] = iℏδᵢⱼ
  [xᵢ,xⱼ] = 0
  [pᵢ,pⱼ] = 0

Angular momentum:
  [Lx,Ly] = iℏLz  (cyclic)
  [L²,Lᵢ] = 0

Heisenberg uncertainty:
  ΔAΔb ≥ ½|⟨[Â,B̂]⟩|
  ΔxΔpx ≥ ℏ/2
  ΔEΔt ≥ ℏ/2

Ehrenfest theorem:
  d⟨x⟩/dt = ⟨p⟩/m
  d⟨p⟩/dt = -⟨∂V/∂x⟩
  (quantum expectation values obey classical equations)
```

## Exactly Solvable Systems

### Infinite Square Well
```
V(x) = 0 for 0 < x < L, ∞ elsewhere

Solutions:
  ψₙ(x) = √(2/L) sin(nπx/L)   n = 1,2,3,...
  Eₙ = n²π²ℏ²/2mL²  =  n²E₁
  E₁ = π²ℏ²/2mL²  (zero-point energy)

Properties:
  Quantized energy — discrete levels
  Zero-point energy: cannot have E = 0
  Wavefunctions: standing waves
  Orthonormal: ⟨m|n⟩ = δₘₙ
```

### Quantum Harmonic Oscillator
```
V(x) = ½mω²x²

Energy levels: Eₙ = (n + ½)ℏω   n = 0,1,2,...
Ground state:  E₀ = ½ℏω  (zero-point energy)

Ladder operators:
  â  = √(mω/2ℏ)(x̂ + ip̂/mω)  (lowering)
  â† = √(mω/2ℏ)(x̂ - ip̂/mω)  (raising)
  [â,â†] = 1
  Ĥ = ℏω(â†â + ½) = ℏω(N̂ + ½)

Matrix elements:
  â|n⟩  = √n |n-1⟩
  â†|n⟩ = √(n+1)|n+1⟩
  x̂ = √(ℏ/2mω)(â + â†)
  p̂ = i√(mωℏ/2)(â† - â)

Ground state wavefunction:
  ψ₀(x) = (mω/πℏ)^(1/4) exp(-mωx²/2ℏ)
```

V(r) = -e²/4πε₀r  (Coulomb potential)

Energy levels:
  Eₙ = -13.6 eV/n²   n = 1,2,3,...
  E₁ = -13.6 eV (ground state)

Quantum numbers:
  n = 1,2,3,...         (principal)
  l = 0,1,...,n-1       (orbital angular momentum)
  m = -l,-l+1,...,l     (magnetic)
  s = ±½                (spin)

Wave functions:
  ψₙₗₘ(r,θ,φ) = Rₙₗ(r) · Yₗᵐ(θ,φ)

Bohr radius: a₀ = 4πε₀ℏ²/me² = 0.529 Å

Selection rules:
  Δl = ±1
  Δm = 0,±1
  Δn = any
```

## Angular Momentum
```
Orbital angular momentum:
  L = r×p
  L² = Lx² + Ly² + Lz²
  Lz = mℏ    m = -l,...,l
  L² = l(l+1)ℏ²

Spin angular momentum:
  Spin-½ particles (electrons, protons, neutrons)
  Sz = mₛℏ   mₛ = ±½
  S² = s(s+1)ℏ² = 3ℏ²/4

Pauli matrices (spin-½):
  σx = [[0,1],[1,0]]
  σy = [[0,-i],[i,0]]
  σz = [[1,0],[0,-1]]
  S = ℏ/2 · σ

Spin states:
  |↑⟩ = |+½⟩ = [1,0]ᵀ  (spin up)
  |↓⟩ = |-½⟩ = [0,1]ᵀ  (spin down)

Addition of angular momenta:
  J = L + S
  j = |l-s|,...,l+s  (Clebsch-Gordan)
  |j,m⟩ = Σ C(l,m₁;s,m₂|j,m) |l,m₁⟩|s,m₂⟩
```

## Quantum Tunneling
```
Tunneling through rectangular barrier (E < V₀):
  Transmission: T ≈ exp(-2κL)
  κ = √(2m(V₀-E))/ℏ
  L = barrier width

WKB approximation:
  T ≈ exp(-2∫√(2m(V(x)-E))/ℏ dx)

Applications:
  Alpha decay: nucleus tunnels through Coulomb barrier
  Scanning tunneling microscope (STM)
  Tunnel diodes
  Nuclear fusion in stars
```

---

## Perturbation Theory
```
H = H₀ + λH'  (λ small perturbation)

First-order energy correction:
  Eₙ¹ = ⟨n⁰|H'|n⁰⟩

First-order state correction:
  |n¹⟩ = Σₖ≠ₙ [⟨k⁰|H'|n⁰⟩/(Eₙ⁰-Eₖ⁰)] |k⁰⟩

Second-order energy correction:
  Eₙ² = Σₖ≠ₙ |⟨k⁰|H'|n⁰⟩|²/(Eₙ⁰-Eₖ⁰)

Degenerate perturbation theory:
  Must diagonalize H' in degenerate subspace first

Time-dependent perturbation theory:
  Fermi's Golden Rule:
  Γᵢ→f = (2π/ℏ)|⟨f|H'|i⟩|² ρ(Ef)
  (transition rate to continuum of final states)
```

---

## Quantum Entanglement & Measurement
```
Entangled state (Bell state):
  |Φ+⟩ = (1/√2)(|↑↑⟩ + |↓↓⟩)
  Cannot be written as |ψ₁⟩⊗|ψ₂⟩

EPR paradox:
  Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen: QM seems non-local
  Measuring one particle instantly affects other

Bell's theorem:
  No local hidden variable theory can reproduce QM predictions
  Bell inequality: |⟨AB⟩+⟨AB'⟩+⟨A'B⟩-⟨A'B'⟩| ≤ 2 (classical)
  QM prediction: can reach 2√2 ≈ 2.83 (violation)
  Experiments confirm QM — nature is non-local

Density matrix:
  Pure state:  ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|,  Tr(ρ²) = 1
  Mixed state: ρ = Σpᵢ|ψᵢ⟩⟨ψᵢ|, Tr(ρ²) < 1
  ⟨A⟩ = Tr(ρÂ)
```

---

## Key Constants
```
ℏ = h/2π = 1.055×10⁻³⁴ J·s  (reduced Planck constant)
h  = 6.626×10⁻³⁴ J·s
me = 9.109×10⁻³¹ kg
e  = 1.602×10⁻¹⁹ C
a₀ = 0.529 Å = 5.29×10⁻¹¹ m  (Bohr radius)
Ry = 13.6 eV  (Rydberg energy)
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Confusing ψ and ψ* | Probability = ψ*ψ = |ψ|² always positive |
| Forgetting normalization | Always check ∫|ψ|²dx = 1 |
| Operator order matters | [Â,B̂] ≠ 0 in general — order is crucial |
| Classical intuition | Quantum particles have no definite position AND momentum |
| Measuring destroys superposition | After measurement state collapses to eigenstate |
| Zero-point energy confusion | Ground state E₀ ≠ 0 for oscillator and well |
