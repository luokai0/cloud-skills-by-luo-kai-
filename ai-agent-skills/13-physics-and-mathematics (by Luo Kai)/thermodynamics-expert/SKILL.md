## The Four Laws
```
Zeroth Law:
  If A is in thermal equilibrium with B, and B with C,
  then A is in thermal equilibrium with C.
  → Defines temperature as a measurable quantity.

First Law (Energy Conservation):
  ΔU = Q - W
  U = internal energy
  Q = heat added TO system (positive in)
  W = work done BY system (positive out)
  Convention: W = ∫PdV for expansion work

Second Law:
  Entropy of an isolated system never decreases.
  ΔS ≥ 0  (equality for reversible processes)
  Heat flows spontaneously from hot to cold.
  No heat engine can be 100% efficient.

Third Law:
  As T → 0K, entropy → constant minimum (S → 0 for perfect crystal)
  Absolute zero is unattainable in finite steps.
```

## Ideal Gas & Thermodynamic Processes
```
Ideal Gas Law:   PV = nRT = NkT
  P = pressure (Pa)
  V = volume (m³)
  n = moles, N = molecules
  R = 8.314 J/mol·K
  k = 1.381×10⁻²³ J/K (Boltzmann constant)
  T = absolute temperature (Kelvin)

Internal Energy:
  Monatomic ideal gas: U = 3/2 nRT
  Diatomic ideal gas:  U = 5/2 nRT
  dU = nCvdT always for ideal gas

Heat Capacities:
  Cv = heat capacity at constant volume
  Cp = heat capacity at constant pressure
  Cp - Cv = R (ideal gas)
  γ = Cp/Cv = 5/3 (monatomic), 7/5 (diatomic)
```

### Thermodynamic Processes
```
Isothermal (T = const):
  PV = const
  W = nRT·ln(Vf/Vi)
  ΔU = 0  →  Q = W

Adiabatic (Q = 0):
  PVγ = const
  TVγ⁻¹ = const
  W = -ΔU = nCv(Ti - Tf)
  ΔS = 0 (reversible adiabatic = isentropic)

Isobaric (P = const):
  W = PΔV = nRΔT
  Q = nCpΔT
  ΔU = nCvΔT

Isochoric (V = const):
  W = 0
  Q = ΔU = nCvΔT
```

---

## Entropy
```
Clausius definition:
  dS = δQrev/T
  ΔS = ∫dQrev/T

For irreversible process:
  ΔS > ∫dQ/T  (Clausius inequality)

Entropy changes:
  Isothermal:   ΔS = Q/T = nR·ln(Vf/Vi)
  Heating:      ΔS = nCv·ln(Tf/Ti)  (const V)
                ΔS = nCp·ln(Tf/Ti)  (const P)
  Phase change: ΔS = L/T  (L = latent heat)
  Mixing:       ΔSmix = -nR·Σxᵢln(xᵢ)

Boltzmann entropy:
  S = k·ln(Ω)
  Ω = number of microstates
  Connection: macroscopic S ↔ microscopic disorder

Second Law statements:
  Kelvin-Planck: No cyclic process converts heat entirely to work
  Clausius:      No process transfers heat from cold to hot spontaneously
  Entropy:       ΔSuniverse ≥ 0
```

## Thermodynamic Cycles & Engines
```python
def carnot_efficiency(T_hot, T_cold):
    """
    Carnot cycle — maximum possible efficiency.
    T in Kelvin.
    """
    eta = 1 - T_cold / T_hot
    cop_refrigerator = T_cold / (T_hot - T_cold)
    cop_heat_pump    = T_hot  / (T_hot - T_cold)

    return {
        'efficiency':       round(eta * 100, 2),
        'COP_refrigerator': round(cop_refrigerator, 3),
        'COP_heat_pump':    round(cop_heat_pump, 3),
        'W_per_Q_hot':      round(eta, 4),
        'note': 'No real engine can exceed Carnot efficiency'
    }

def otto_cycle(r, gamma=1.4):
    """
    Otto cycle (gasoline engine).
    r = compression ratio = V_max/V_min
    """
    efficiency = 1 - r**(1 - gamma)
    return {
        'compression_ratio': r,
        'efficiency':        round(efficiency * 100, 2),
        'note':              'Higher compression = higher efficiency'
    }

def rankine_cycle(h1, h2, h3, h4, pump_work):
    """
    Rankine cycle (steam power plant).
    h = specific enthalpy at each state point.
    """
    turbine_work  = h3 - h4
    heat_input    = h3 - h2
    net_work      = turbine_work - pump_work
    efficiency    = net_work / heat_input

    return {
        'turbine_work':  round(turbine_work, 2),
        'heat_input':    round(heat_input, 2),
        'net_work':      round(net_work, 2),
        'efficiency':    round(efficiency * 100, 2)
    }
```

### Cycle Summary
```

Otto:     Two isochoric + two adiabatic (gasoline engine)
          η = 1 - r^(1-γ)

Diesel:   Two adiabatic + one isobaric + one isochoric
          Higher compression than Otto

Brayton:  Two adiabatic + two isobaric (jet engine, gas turbine)
          η = 1 - r^((1-γ)/γ)  (r = pressure ratio)

## Free Energy & Equilibrium
```
Helmholtz Free Energy:
  A = U - TS
  dA = -SdT - PdV
  At constant T,V: spontaneous if ΔA < 0

Gibbs Free Energy:
  G = H - TS  =  U + PV - TS
  dG = -SdT + VdP
  At constant T,P: spontaneous if ΔG < 0
  At equilibrium:  ΔG = 0

Enthalpy:
  H = U + PV
  dH = TdS + VdP
  At constant P: Q = ΔH

Chemical potential:
  μ = (∂G/∂n)T,P
  Equilibrium: μ₁ = μ₂ (phases in contact)

Van't Hoff equation:
  d(lnK)/dT = ΔH°/RT²
  lnK = -ΔG°/RT = -ΔH°/RT + ΔS°/R
```

---

## Phase Transitions
```
Clausius-Clapeyron equation:
  dP/dT = L / (TΔv) = ΔS/ΔV

  For liquid-vapor (ideal gas approximation):
  d(lnP)/dT = L/RT²
  → ln(P₂/P₁) = -L/R · (1/T₂ - 1/T₁)

Latent heat:
  Q = mL  (no temperature change during phase transition)
  Fusion (solid→liquid):    Lf ≈ 334 kJ/kg (water)
  Vaporization (liq→gas):   Lv ≈ 2260 kJ/kg (water)

Triple point: all three phases coexist
Critical point: liquid-gas distinction disappears

First order transitions: discontinuous V, S, H (boiling, melting)
Second order transitions: continuous V, S but discontinuous Cp
```

---

## Heat Transfer
```
Conduction:
  Q/t = kA(ΔT/L)   (Fourier's Law)
  k = thermal conductivity (W/m·K)
  R = L/kA          (thermal resistance)

Convection:
  Q/t = hAΔT        (Newton's Law of Cooling)
  h = convection coefficient (W/m²·K)

Radiation:
  P = εσAT⁴         (Stefan-Boltzmann Law)
  σ = 5.67×10⁻⁸ W/m²·K⁴
  ε = emissivity (0 to 1)
  Net: P = εσA(T⁴ - T_surr⁴)

Wien's Displacement Law:
  λ_max · T = 2.898×10⁻³ m·K
  Peak wavelength shifts to shorter λ at higher T
```

---

## Statistical Mechanics Foundations
```
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution:
  f(v) = 4π(m/2πkT)^(3/2) · v² · exp(-mv²/2kT)

  Most probable speed: vp = √(2kT/m)
  Mean speed:          <v> = √(8kT/πm)
  RMS speed:           vrms = √(3kT/m)

Equipartition theorem:
  Each quadratic degree of freedom contributes ½kT to energy
  Monatomic gas: 3 translational = 3/2 kT per molecule
  Diatomic gas:  3 trans + 2 rot = 5/2 kT per molecule

Partition function:
  Z = Σᵢ exp(-εᵢ/kT)
  F = -kT·ln(Z)    (Helmholtz free energy)
  <E> = kT²·∂(lnZ)/∂T

Boltzmann factor:
  Probability of state i: P(i) = exp(-εᵢ/kT) / Z
```

---

## Key Constants
```
R  = 8.314 J/mol·K     (gas constant)
k  = 1.381×10⁻²³ J/K  (Boltzmann constant)
NA = 6.022×10²³ /mol   (Avogadro's number)
σ  = 5.67×10⁻⁸ W/m²K⁴ (Stefan-Boltzmann)
1 atm = 101325 Pa
0°C = 273.15 K
```

## Common Pitfalls

| Pitfall | Fix |
|---|---|
| Wrong sign convention for Q and W | Define clearly: Q>0 in, W>0 out (physics) |
| Celsius instead of Kelvin | Always use Kelvin in thermodynamics equations |
| Forgetting irreversibility | Real processes always have ΔS_universe > 0 |
| Confusing heat and temperature | Q = mcΔT — they are not the same thing |
| Adiabatic vs isothermal confusion | Adiabatic: Q=0, isothermal: ΔT=0 |
| Enthalpy vs internal energy | Use ΔH at constant P, ΔU at constant V |
